# KNoq

Not Coq, but also not Noq, instead written in Kotlin.
This project is a very basic proofing assistant.
In my case, I implemented it to check my theory that automatically bruteforcing simple proofs should being relatively easy.

Inspired by Tsoding:

My project uses my game engine, because it's my toolbox for me :).
If it need be, you can easily extract the missing functions.
